## 🚀 About The Project

ArtVPP redefines the online art buying experience. Moving away from static galleries, it uses **cinematic storytelling** and **interactive design** to showcase art in its best light. Whether you're buying a physical painting, a digital asset, or commissioning a unique piece, ArtVPP makes the process elegant and intuitive.

**This is a fully functional Frontend Demo.** It simulates a complete marketplace ecosystem without requiring a backend database, making it perfect for judging and evaluation.
